## About This Project

**This is a hobby project.** I'm a full-time web developer, and Spell Casters is my playground for exploring cutting-edge AI tools and staying in the loop with what's possible in modern web development. It's a passion project born from my love of Magic: The Gathering and curiosity about emerging technologies like browser-based machine learning, WebRTC, and computer vision.

## Vision

Spell Casters aims to provide a comprehensive remote play experience for Magic: The Gathering players, competing with platforms like SpellTable by offering:

- **Multi-party Video & Voice**: Browser-based video chat optimized for overhead camera views of playmats (2-4 players per game)
- **Intelligent Card Recognition**: Computer vision powered by CLIP to identify cards in real-time and display rulings/details
- **Game Management Tools**: Life total tracking, commander damage tracking, and game timers
- **Flexible Room System**: Create or join private/public game rooms with format and power level metadata for better matchmaking
- **Device Flexibility**: Use standard webcams or mobile devices as overhead cameras without separate apps
- **Fully Browser-Based**: No installation required—works on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Current Features

The following features are currently available and working:

- ✅ **Room System**: Create and join game rooms with real-time player presence
- ✅ **Multi-party Video/Audio Chat**: WebRTC-powered video and audio communication between players
- ✅ **Webcam Integration**: Use your webcam as an overhead camera for your playmat
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Sign in with Convex authentication
- ✅ **Life Total Tracking**: Keep track of life totals for all players
- ✅ **Commander Damage Tracking**: Track commander damage across multiple opponents
- ✅ **Invite by URL**: Share a link to invite friends to your game room

## Coming Soon

These features are actively being developed:

- 🚧 **Card Recognition**: Click-to-identify cards using CLIP-based visual search and Scryfall integration (in progress)
- 🚧 **Card Boundary Detection**: OpenCV.js for real-time card detection in video feeds (in progress)
- 🚧 **Pre-computed Embeddings**: Database of ~20k+ MTG card embeddings for fast similarity search (in progress)

## Planned Features

Future enhancements on the roadmap:

- **Public/Private Room Matchmaking**: Find games with players of similar formats and power levels
- **User Accounts and Game History**: Track your play sessions over time
- **Replay and Spectator Modes**: Watch games or review past sessions

## Target Use Case

Spell Casters is designed for Magic: The Gathering players who want to play with their physical cards remotely against friends. The platform enables:

- **Remote Play Sessions**: Play paper MTG with friends across distances using video chat
- **Casual & Competitive Play**: Support for various formats (Commander, Modern, Standard, etc.) with power level indicators
- **Card Identification**: Quickly identify cards on camera for rules lookups and oracle text (coming soon)
- **Game State Tracking**: Keep track of life totals and commander damage
- **Flexible Setup**: Use any webcam or smartphone as an overhead camera—no special equipment needed

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

2. **Start the Convex development server:**

   ```sh
   bun run convex:dev
   ```

3. **Start the Web development server:**

   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```

4. **Open the app:**
   Navigate to https://localhost:1234 to get started.

## Observability

Sentry is integrated across the Convex backend and web client. See
[`docs/sentry.md`](./docs/sentry.md) for configuration, CI setup, and verification
steps.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo monorepo houses all applications and packages needed to drive the Spell Casters platform:

### Apps and Packages

- **`web`**: Main web application for remote MTG play (Vite + React + TanStack Router)
  - Room system with real-time player presence
  - WebRTC video/audio chat
  - Card recognition (in development)
- **`@repo/mtg-image-db`**: Pre-generated CLIP embeddings and metadata for MTG card database
  - Python pipeline for downloading Scryfall data
  - FAISS index builder for efficient similarity search
  - Browser-optimized export (int8 quantization)
- **`@repo/ui`**: Shared React component library
- **`@repo/eslint-config`**: Shared ESLint configurations
- **`@repo/typescript-config`**: Shared TypeScript configurations
- **`@repo/tailwind-config`**: Shared Tailwind CSS configuration
- **`@repo/prettier-config`**: Shared Prettier configuration

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Python for data pipeline).

### Key Technologies

**Frontend**:

- React 19, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS
- Vite with TypeScript
- Convex for authentication

**Real-time Communication**:

- WebRTC for peer-to-peer video/audio
- Convex for real-time data sync and room management

**Card Recognition** (in development):

- CLIP (via [@huggingface/transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js)) for image feature extraction
- OpenCV.js for real-time card boundary detection
- FAISS for efficient similarity search

**Infrastructure**:

- Turborepo managed with Bun workspaces
- Python data pipeline with PyTorch, FAISS, Scryfall API

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd spell-casters-mono

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
bunx turbo run build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build --filter=docs

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
bunx turbo run build --filter=docs
```
